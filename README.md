# Project Overview
> In this project, we are going to clean Nashville Housing dataset. We have performed to do as the following tasks:
* Standardize date format
* Populate missing property address data
* Parsing long-formatted address into individual columns (Address, City, State)
* Standardize “Sold as Vacant” field (from Y/N to Yes and No)
* Remove Duplicates

# Project Outcome
* Date Standadization across the dataset, so the data can be used for further analysis in Tableau, Power BI etc.
* Removed inconsistency by populating the missing address in the records witht the help of parcelID, so it becomes easy to analyse the data.
* Splitted the Property address into state, city and street, so that the data can be analysed on them.
* Completely modified the Y to "Yes" and N to "No" in the Sold as vacant column, so that effective filter can be applied.
* Removed the duplicates in the data across for better performance.
* Removed the unused columns in the database for better performance.
